Relatively simple logic, starting with the set of 3-digit squares, grouping together those with common digit triplets. Testing sets of 4 permutations of each such triplet that include only 1 square, and collecting only those that sum to a prime.
Grouping the results according to the first digit of the prime sum, we look for a group that meets the solution logic.

Initially I took the solution logic to imply the group with a unique set of hymns for a given first digit. However, Jim Randell points out that this still leaves two solutions with a unique first hymn. I have therefore amended my logic to follow his suggested interpretation.

We pick the group of possible hymn sequences that have the same initial digit for the prime sum, but for which we can only tell the first hymn given that digit.

With the other possible group, we could identify ALL the hymns given the first digit.
